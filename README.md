# My Node.js Template

This is a template for creating a Node.js project with Express, TypeScript, Winston logger, linting, and Dockerfile. It includes documentation and security checks using Yarn.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/my-nodejs-template.git
cd my-nodejs-template
yarn install
```

## Running the Server

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript and start the server at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Running in Development Mode

To run the server in development mode, which automatically re-compiles the code when changes are made, run the following command:

```bash
 yarn start:dev
```

This will start the server using `nodemon`.

## Linting

To run the linter and check for linting errors, run the following command:

```bash
yarn lint
```

To automatically fix linting errors, run the following command:

```bash
yarn lint:fix
```

## Security Checks

To run security checks using `npm audit`, run the following command:

```bash
npm audit
```

This will scan your project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities against the Node.js Advisory database.

## Docker

To build a Docker image for your project, run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t my-nodejs-template .
```

To run the Docker container, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 my-nodejs-template
```

## Configuration

The server can be configured using environment variables. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and modify the values as necessary:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
